- 👋 Hi, I’m @kjspann
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, practicing, implementing... and actually USING the "programming knowledge" I learned in college (a good decade+ ago, so starting with what little I've managed to retain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about crypto currencies, defi, nft's, as well as soaking up all I can about finance related to investing, trading, etc., mostly crypto, but stocks and options as well, along with technical analysis and beginning strategies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well, probably not gonna be of much use until I "refresh my memory", fill in any "gaps" I may find missing, learn about changes, differences and whatnot since I've last compiled anything. "Hands-on" is one of my best ways to learn. Love to see what all can be done when all that college coding is applied to real-world practical uses. To actually work on/create something USEFUL!
